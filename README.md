# OnshapeFlaskServer
Python-based Flask Server for communicating with Onshape

Lead developer: Alexander Koppel

---
## Description:

This project creates a flask server that can be accessed within Onshape as an "*Integrated Cloud App*" through the 
"*App Store*" as an app called "*[Tufts CEEO Flask App](https://appstore.onshape.com/apps/Design%20&%20Documentation/L2TGY3UQFV4RPW7XMYDTQ76QXIK6NYLFUBT7NSI=/description)*"
(which is private to the Rogers Onshape Enterprise at the moment). This flask server uses Onshape's REST API to edit and 
display information about the current workspace in real time. 

For more information about Onshape's REST API you can:
- Look at Onshape's [integration guides](https://github.com/PTC-Education/Onshape-Integration-Guides)
- Read their documentation provided on [Glasswork](https://cad.onshape.com/glassworks/explorer/#/)
- Check out example API calls through PTC's [API playground](https://github.com/PTC-Education/PTC-API-Playground)

This project started using Onshape's [*Heat Sink Design Project*](https://github.com/PTC-Education/Heat-Sink-Design) 
as a base along with Onshape's [*Four Bar Mechanism Design Project*](https://github.com/PTC-Education/Four-Bar-Mechanism) 
as inspiration for the "*CEEO Rotate & Graph*" extension.

This project contains three separate tools:
- CEEO Rotate & Graph
- CEEO Image Maker
- CEEO GIF Maker
